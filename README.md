Below is a **clean, natural README rewrite** you can drop straight into your **Projects** repo.
It’s written to sound like a real developer portfolio (not AI-ish), clearly explains *why* the repo exists, and specifically calls out **PygameHexGridDemo** → **JavaScript translation**, and the **Electron demo** with proper attribution.

# Projects

This repository is a collection of **small, focused projects** I’ve built to learn, experiment, and improve my programming skills across different languages, frameworks, and environments.

Each project here was created for **educational purposes** — either to understand a concept more deeply, explore a new technology, or translate an idea from one language or platform to another. Some projects are prototypes, others are demos, and a few serve as the foundation for work showcased in my portfolio.

## Project Highlights

### PygameHexGridDemo

This project started as a **Python demo using Pygame**, built to explore:

* Hex grid math and layout logic
* Coordinate systems and spatial reasoning
* Rendering grids and animations in a game-style environment

After completing the Python version, I **translated the core logic to JavaScript** and adapted it for the web as part of my portfolio. This helped me better understand how the same concepts map across languages and rendering systems.

* **Original demo**: Python + Pygame
* **Translated version**: JavaScript (web-based)
* **Live portfolio version**:

  * Repository: [https://github.com/0utsights/0utsights.github.io](https://github.com/0utsights/0utsights.github.io)
  * Website: [https://johnsurles.com](https://johnsurles.com)

This project represents my approach to learning: build something tangible, then rebuild it in a different environment to reinforce understanding.

### Electron Demo Project

This project is a **desktop application demo built with Electron**, using:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

The goal was to understand how web technologies can be packaged into a cross-platform desktop application, including:

* Electron project structure
* Window lifecycle and configuration
* Frontend styling inside a desktop runtime

The demo is **based on** (and inspired by) the following open-source project:
[https://github.com/nasha-wanich/little-calendar/tree/main](https://github.com/nasha-wanich/little-calendar/tree/main)

I used this as a learning reference and rebuilt parts of it to better understand how Electron applications are structured and how web UI translates into a desktop context.

---

## Purpose of This Repository

* Practice and reinforce programming fundamentals
* Learn new tools, libraries, and frameworks
* Translate concepts across languages (Python → JavaScript, web → desktop)
* Build a public record of my learning process

Not every project here is meant to be “production-ready.” Instead, this repo serves as a **working notebook** of experiments, demos, and skill-building exercises.

## Technologies Used

Across the projects in this repository, you’ll find work involving:

* Python
* JavaScript
* HTML / CSS
* Pygame
* Electron
* Basic game math and rendering concepts

## Notes

Some projects may be incomplete, experimental, or intentionally simple. That’s by design — each one represents a specific learning goal at the time it was created.
