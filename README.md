# Projects

This repository is a collection of **small, focused projects** built to learn, experiment, and improve programming skills across different languages, frameworks, and environments.

Each project targets a specific concept or technology. Some are prototypes, some are demos, and a few serve as the foundation for portfolio work. This repository is intentionally **learning-oriented**, not production-focused.

## Project Highlights

### PygameHexGridDemo

A hex grid demo originally built in **Python + Pygame**, later rewritten in **JavaScript** for the web.

**Focus:**

* Hex grid math and layout logic
* Coordinate systems
* Grid rendering and animation

**Versions:**

* Original: Python + Pygame
* Web port: JavaScript

**Links:**

* Repository: [https://github.com/0utsights/0utsights.github.io](https://github.com/0utsights/0utsights.github.io)
* Website: [https://johnsurles.com](https://johnsurles.com)

Built once, then rebuilt in a new environment to reinforce core concepts.

### Electron Demo Project

A **desktop application demo** built with Electron using standard web technologies.

**Focus:**

* Electron project structure
* Window lifecycle and configuration
* Styling web UIs in a desktop runtime

Inspired by:
[https://github.com/nasha-wanich/little-calendar/tree/main](https://github.com/nasha-wanich/little-calendar/tree/main)

Used as a reference to understand how web apps translate into cross-platform desktop applications.

### Pokédex Web Demo

A simple **Pokédex-style web app** that fetches and displays Pokémon data from a public API.

**Focus:**

* API consumption
* Async JavaScript
* DOM manipulation
* Basic UI layout

Built as a learning project and a foundation for future terminal-based and ASCII-rendered versions.

---

## Purpose of This Repository

* Practice and reinforce programming fundamentals
* Learn new tools, libraries, and frameworks
* Translate concepts across languages and platforms
* Maintain a public record of learning progress

This repo serves as a **working notebook** of experiments and skill-building projects.

## Technologies Used

* Python
* JavaScript
* HTML / CSS
* Pygame
* Electron
* Basic game math and rendering concepts

## Notes

Some projects may be incomplete, experimental, or intentionally simple. Each one reflects a specific learning goal at the time it was created.
